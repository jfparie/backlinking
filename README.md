# Backlinking
Reviewing backlinking for search engine 'optimalisation' 

> **Backlink:** "A backlink for a given web resource is a link from some other website (the referrer) to that web resource (the referent). A web resource may be (for example) a website, web page, or web directory. [...] The quantity, quality, and relevance of backlinks for a web page are among the factors that search engines like Google evaluate in order to estimate how important the page is."
